# Ad Group Age Criterion Record - Bulk
Defines an ad group age criterion that can be uploaded and downloaded in a bulk file. 

You can target customers by age so that your ads are displayed more frequently to people who will be interested in them. 

Each age criterion defines an age range for the accompanying criterion bid adjustment. 

The maximum number of age criterions that you can specify per campaign or ad group is five, i.e. one for each of the supported age ranges *EighteenToTwentyFour*, *TwentyFiveToThirtyFour*, *ThirtyFiveToFortyNine*, *FiftyToSixtyFour*, and *SixtyFiveAndAbove*.

## <a name="entitydata"></a>Attribute Fields in the Bulk File
For an *Ad Group Age Criterion* record, the following attribute fields are available in the [Bulk File Schema](bulk-file-schema.md). 

- [Ad Group](#adgroup)
- [Bid Adjustment](#bidadjustment)
- [Campaign](#campaign)
- [Client Id](#clientid)
- [Id](#id)
- [Modified Time](#modifiedtime)
- [Parent Id](#parentid)
- [Status](#status)
- [Target](#target)

You can download all fields of the *Ad Group Age Criterion* record by including the [DownloadEntity](downloadentity.md) value of *AdGroupTargetCriterions* in the [DownloadCampaignsByAccountIds](downloadcampaignsbyaccountids.md) or [DownloadCampaignsByCampaignIds](downloadcampaignsbycampaignids.md) service request. Additionally the download request must include the [DataScope](datascope.md) value of *EntityData*. For more information, see [Bulk Download and Upload](../guides/bulk-download-upload.md).

The following Bulk CSV example would add a new ad group age criterion if a valid ad group identifier (*Parent Id*) is provided. 

```csv
Type,Status,Id,Parent Id,Sub Type,Campaign,Ad Group,Client Id,Modified Time,Target,Bid Adjustment,Name,OS Names,Radius,Unit,From Hour,From Minute,To Hour,To Minute,Latitude,Longitude
Format Version,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,
Ad Group Age Criterion,Active,,-1111,,,,ClientIdGoesHere,,EighteenToTwentyFour,20,,,,,,,,,,
```

If you are using the [Bing Ads SDKs](../guides/client-libraries.md) for .NET, Java, or Python, you can save time using the *BulkServiceManager* to upload and download the *BulkAdGroupAgeCriterion* class, instead of calling the service operations directly and writing custom code to parse each field in the bulk file. 

```csharp
var uploadEntities = new List<BulkEntity>();

// Map properties in the Bulk file to the BulkAdGroupAgeCriterion
var bulkAdGroupAgeCriterion = new BulkAdGroupAgeCriterion
{
    // 'Ad Group' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    AdGroupName = null,
                    
    // 'Campaign' column header in the Bulk file is read-only
    CampaignName = null,
    
    // 'Client Id' column header in the Bulk file
    ClientId = "ClientIdGoesHere",

    // Map properties in the Bulk file to the 
    // BiddableAdGroupCriterion object of the Campaign Management service.

    AdGroupCriterion = new BiddableAdGroupCriterion
    {
        // 'Parent Id' column header in the Bulk file
        AdGroupId = adGroupIdKey,

        Criterion = new AgeCriterion
        {
            // 'Target' column header in the Bulk file
            AgeRange = AgeRange.EighteenToTwentyFour,
        },

        CriterionBid = new BidMultiplier
        {
            // 'Bid Adjustment' column header in the Bulk file
            Multiplier = 20,
        },

        // 'Id' column header in the Bulk file
        Id = null,

        // 'Status' column header in the Bulk file
        Status = AdGroupCriterionStatus.Active,
    }
};

uploadEntities.Add(bulkAdGroupAgeCriterion);

var entityUploadParameters = new EntityUploadParameters
{
    Entities = uploadEntities,
    ResponseMode = ResponseMode.ErrorsAndResults,
    ResultFileDirectory = FileDirectory,
    ResultFileName = DownloadFileName,
    OverwriteResultFile = true,
};

var uploadResultEntities = (await BulkService.UploadEntitiesAsync(entityUploadParameters)).ToList();
```

### <a name="adgroup"></a>Ad Group
The name of the ad group where this criterion is applied or removed.  

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="bidadjustment"></a>Bid Adjustment
The percentage amount that you want to adjust the bid for the corresponding *Target*. 

Supported values are negative ninety (-90) through positive nine hundred (900). 

> [!NOTE]
> If the campaign uses MaxClicks, MaxConversions, or TargetCpa bid strategy types, then the multiplier will inform rather than directly modify or override the automated bid. For auto bidding the multiplier is used as a weighted percentage to inform Bing Ads about how much you value the criterion relative to other criteria. For example, a -50% bid multiplier for a mobile device criterion with the Max Conversions bid strategy to indicate that you value conversions from mobile traffic half as much as other device types. The same bid multiplier with the Max Clicks bid strategy would indicate that you value clicks on mobile half as much as other device types.
> Additionally, if the campaign uses MaxClicks, MaxConversions, or TargetCpa bid strategy types, the valid range of values that you can use to inform auto bidding is -100.00 through 30.00.

**Add:** Optional. The bid adjustment will be set to the default of *0* if not included.  
**Update:** Required  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="campaign"></a>Campaign
The name of the campaign that contains the ad group where this criterion is applied or removed.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="clientid"></a>Client Id
Used to associate records in the bulk upload file with records in the results file. The value of this field is not used or stored by the server; it is simply copied from the uploaded record to the corresponding result record. It may be any valid string to up 100 in length.

**Add:** Optional  
**Update:** Optional    
**Delete:** Optional  

### <a name="id"></a>Id
The Bing Ads unique identifier of the criterion.

> [!NOTE] 
> Previously with Campaign Management API version 10 it was possible to associate one target identifier with multiple campaigns and ad groups using the AddTargetsToLibrary, SetTargetToCampaign, and SetTargetToAdGroup operations. After a campaign or ad group had been disassociated from the shared target, the criterion identifier would be set to *0* (zero) in the Bulk download or Bulk upload result file. 

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

### <a name="modifiedtime"></a>Modified Time
The date and time that the entity was last updated. The value is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

> [!NOTE]
> The date and time value reflects the date and time at the server, not the client. For information about the format of the date and time, see the dateTime entry in [Primitive XML Data Types](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=859198).

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Read-only  
**Delete:** Read-only  

### <a name="parentid"></a>Parent Id
The identifier of the ad group where this criterion is applied or removed.
	
This bulk field maps to the *Id* field of the [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record. 

**Add:** Read-only and Required. You must either specify an existing ad group identifier, or specify a negative identifier that is equal to the *Id* field of the parent [Ad Group](ad-group.md) record. This is recommended if you are adding new criterions to a new ad group in the same Bulk file. For more information, see [Bulk File Schema Reference Keys](../bulk-service/bulk-file-schema.md#referencekeys).  
**Update:** Read-only and Required  
**Delete:** Read-only and Required  

### <a name="status"></a>Status
Represents the association status between the ad group and the criterion bid. If the criterion bid is set for the ad group, this field's value is *Active*, and otherwise the value is *Deleted*.

**Add:** Read-only  
**Update:** Optional  
**Delete:** Required. The Status must be set to *Deleted*. To delete a specific age criterion bid, you must upload the *Status*, *Id*, and *Parent Id*.

### <a name="target"></a>Target
The age range that you want to target with the corresponding *Bid Adjustment*. 

Supported values are *EighteenToTwentyFour*, *TwentyFiveToThirtyFour*, *ThirtyFiveToFortyNine*, *FiftyToSixtyFour*, and *SixtyFiveAndAbove*. 

> [!NOTE]
> In many countries, online advertisers are not supposed to target any users less than 18 years old. Bing Ads does not deliver interest-based advertising to children whose birthdate in their Microsoft account identifies them as under 13 years of age. For more information see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
> 
> Currently people ages 13 to 17 can see your ads, although you cannot adjust the bid for that age range. Soon in Bing Ads you will be enabled to specifically exclude ages 13 to 17. The target value of *ThirteenToSeventeen* will be supported with negative bid adjustments between -100 and 0. We will announce more specific dates within the next few months.

**Add:** Required  
**Update:** Required  
**Delete:** Read-only
